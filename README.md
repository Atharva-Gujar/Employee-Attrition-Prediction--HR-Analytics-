The Employee Attrition Prediction project focuses on using machine learning techniques to predict whether an employee is likely to leave an organization. It falls under the broader category of HR Analytics and helps companies identify at-risk employees before they decide to leave, allowing HR teams to take proactive steps to reduce turnover and improve retention.

Project Description:
In this project, you will analyze historical employee data to understand the key factors contributing to employee attrition. By building a predictive model, you can estimate the probability of an employee leaving the company based on various features such as demographics, job role, work environment, salary, performance, and more.

Key Tasks:
Data Collection: Gather relevant employee data, including attributes like:

Age, gender, education, marital status

Job role, department, and tenure at the company

Salary, benefits, promotions, and performance scores

Work-life balance, training, and career development opportunities

Employee satisfaction scores, and historical attrition data (left or stayed)

Data Preprocessing: Clean and prepare the data for analysis by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables (e.g., gender, department), and scaling numerical features.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Perform EDA to identify trends, correlations, and patterns that may indicate reasons for employee attrition. This can involve:

Visualizing distributions of key features

Checking for correlations between features

Identifying outliers and addressing them

Feature Engineering: Create new features if necessary, such as grouping employees into tenure brackets or creating a "work-life balance" score based on survey responses.

Model Building: Choose appropriate machine learning algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost) and train the model using historical data to predict employee attrition.

Model Evaluation: Use metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and AUC-ROC to evaluate the modelâ€™s performance. Ensure the model is not overfitting and generalizes well to new data.

Prediction & Insights: Once the model is trained and tested, use it to predict which employees are likely to leave. Provide actionable insights to the HR team, such as:

Identifying at-risk employees

Suggesting strategies to improve retention (e.g., career development opportunities, changes in compensation, better work-life balance)

Tools & Techniques:
Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn)

Machine Learning Algorithms (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.)

Model Evaluation (Confusion Matrix, AUC-ROC, etc.)

Jupyter Notebook for documenting and presenting the analysis.
